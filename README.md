Zombie Apocalypse game!

Right click mainAndDeathScreen.py and run it with python 2.7 to run the game!
Each class is split up into different .py files. DO NOT touch the black .py files. Only the white ones! To make a new class, just make a new file and code it there! See the classes that are written to see how to import other classes and use them.
