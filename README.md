# Zombie Road
A space-invaders style scroller game that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world that increases in difficulty the longer you play, where all you have is a modified car with weapons attached to it to take out zombies that are hungry and attacking your car as you drive. 

## Usage
To Install the game double click Zombie Road Installer.exe and extract the files to any location.
This will create a Zombie Road folder, and you can double click the .exe file in that folder to play the game.

This game will only work with Windows, due to the final product being packaged together into an .exe
